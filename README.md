## Purpose
The intitial Horiseon code was presented to me, but has been edited for more clarification and organization. 

### Some examples of those changes include:
- Tags edited to specific section, article, header, footer, etc. tags
- ID tags fixed so all work in navigation section
- Images given alt attributes for better accessibility
- Classes were changed to combine unneccesary individual classes
- Style sheet consolidated to reflect changes in index.html 
- Comments made on style sheet and index.html for clear understanding of changes made
